Small plane path calculator

1. Create an airport data structure that accomodates the designator, the long name, the airport location (city,state)
   and the geocoded value.
2. Graph data structure
3. Load into the Graph all the airports as vertices
4. For each vertex v
    For all neighbors u
        if Edge v, u does not exist
            calculate distance with google maps api and airport geolocations
5. Interface: given two airports, find the most advantageous flight path, prioritizing major hubs

Calculating optimum flight path
Range of aircraft is the limiting factor

Edge weight is based on three things:
    Distance: the optimum flight distance is 3/4 the range.
    Destination type: P-M (medium traffic) are the most advantageous, with P-S, P-N, and P-L in descending order
